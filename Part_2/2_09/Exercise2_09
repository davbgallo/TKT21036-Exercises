# Description
after spending way too much time, my solution has been to override ENV vars in Dockerfile for both frontend and backend
- Frontend: ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api
- Backend: ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost

This is needed as by the schema in exercise 2.8, NGINX has to proxy the communications between these 2 containers

I still don't understand why I could not override the environment section in docker-compose.yml. Instead, I built the Dockerfile directly with `docker compose` and I pass the ENV as ARG. Probably is due to some building process in the base layer image?

This is also the solution for Exercise 2.10.
