# Description
after spending way too much time, my solution has been to override ENV vars in Dockerfile for both frontend and backend
- Frontend: ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api
- Backend: ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost

this is needed as by the schema in exercise 2.8 the NGINX has to proxy the communications between these 2 containers

I still don't understand why I could not override the environment section in docker-compose.yml. Instead I build the Dockerfile directly with docker compose and I pass the ENV as ARG. Probably is due to the base layer

This is also the solution for Exercise 2.10.
